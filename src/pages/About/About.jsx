          Hello, I am Soumyajit Karmakar, a B.tech Undergraduate student based in Kolkata. I am a self-taught front-end web-developer, with an unwavering passion for designing and competitive programming.
          <br />
          <br />
          My developing style involves using Figma for design and primarily React as the javascript front-end framework
          for coding. Owing to my passion for arts, I can design engaging, user-friendly websites for seamless workflow. I am also an avid Competitive programmer and often give contests on popular
          programming platforms to enhance my programming skills.
